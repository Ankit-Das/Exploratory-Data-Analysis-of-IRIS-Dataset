# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-IRIS-Dataset
Data Analysis of Iris dataset  by using methods like univariate and bivariate analysis.Suppose we pick a flower from set of three set of flowers:setosa,vercicolor,verginica.We have to determine to which set it belongs based on dimension of flower.
# Load the csv file using pandas library.
# Import matplotlib and seaborn for plotting histogram,pairplot,box plot.
# Univariate analysis - Plot the histogram and box plot using one variable(Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length, Petal Width).
                        This determines which single variable is used for determining to which flower data set the flower belongs 
                        based on single variable.
# Bivariate analysis - Plot the pair using two variable combination(Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length, Petal Width).
                        This determines which two variable is used for determining to which flower data set the flower belongs 
                        based on two variable.
