# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-IRIS-Dataset
# Load the csv file using pandas library.
# Import matplotlib and seaborn for plotting histogram,pairplot,box plot.
# Univariate analysis - Plot the histogram and box plot using one variable(Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length, Petal Width).
#                        This determines which single variable is used for determining to which flower data set the flower belongs 
#                        based on single variable.
# Bivariate analysis - Plot the pair using two variable combination(Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length, Petal Width).
#                        This determines which two variable is used for determining to which flower data set the flower belongs 
#                        based on two variable.
